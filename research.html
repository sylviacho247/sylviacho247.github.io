      <h2>Research Interests</h2>

      <p>My research lies at the intersection of phonetics, multilingualism, speech science, and applied linguistics.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Multilingualism:</strong> One of my main research interests concerns how multilingualism influences voice quality, articulatory gestures, speech perception and production (including both categorical and within-category dimensions), sound change, and language acquisition. I am particularly interested in how multilingual speakers navigate and manage distinct phonetic and phonological systems across languages.

    </ul></li><br>
  <li><strong>Speech Disorders:</strong> I am interested in how speech disorders — for example, neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s disease — affect articulation and voice quality. I am also interested in the relationship between speech and other motor domains, such as fine and gross motor control, and how these systems interact in both healthy and clinical populations.

    </ul>
  </li><br>
<li><strong>Applied Phonetics:</strong> I aim to bridge the gap between linguistic theory and real-world practices by exploring how insights from phonetic research can be translated into effective tools for pronunciation instruction, forensic linguistics, and speech-based AI technologies.
